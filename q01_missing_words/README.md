## Write a function `q01_missing_words()` that:

        -takes two strings s and t as parameters
        -finds out the longest common subsequence of s in t
        -creates a list that contains the words missing from s(in order)
        -returns the above created list
        
For eg if s='I like computer programming' and t='I programming', 'I programming' is the longest subsequence and 'like computer' is the list of missing words in order.
